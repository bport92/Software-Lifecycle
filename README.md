# Software-Lifecycle

# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this? 
By listening to the user's reviews and responses I can interpret different aspects of what they are talking about and then implement it into the program by first discussing what is important and what may be less important. Completing a priority list and then reviewing that list. Then we put in what can be done and what is the most effective. This is the basic principle of the user story. To take the information put it into a user story list and then figure out what is the most important priority and what challenges will be faced. 

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
First understanding the problem and defining the issues, gathering requirements design and architecture, and then choosing an agile framework. In this case, we would choose Scrum. Create a backlog and then proceed with the necessary step sto perform a proper agile approach using Scrum. This would include daily meetings and continuing development and testing. I would like to use Scrum in the future and the different types of Scrum, I think at this level introducing a minor amount of change would be ideal but getting more in-depth into Agile and Scrum would be the focus later. 

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
I think a good team member is someone who is going to listen to new ideas, take criticism, and pull their share of work. In this case that would be someone who can openly collaborate about issues and their ups and downs in order to get good collaboration and create a good product. A good team member is someone who shows up to the meetings an gets the information but is also willing to help if that availability is available. Strong technical and problem-solving skills, quality focus, and accountability. 

# My Class Feedback
In this github all of the Journals are added to show perspective.
Added some of the projects, only wanted to add the projects that I found the most useful. 

This class showed me more than most of the classes I have had in my opinion, this was a solid class that peaked my interest.
In this class, we go over Scrum, evaluate different roles in agile and waterful, and make a conscious choice as to why one may be best. To me, agile is a great way to run a team, prioritize tasks, and work as a team. I really enjoyed learning how to work as a team and how teams function. I really enjoy the way that scrum works. I love the leadership and input that this method carries. I have been in manufacturing for a long time and I have never had a role where I get a say, where I get to voice an opinion or bring awareness to an issue but this brings me hope for the future, shows me leadership and I am glad that I can take this to the next level of my future career.
