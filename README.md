# Software-Lifecycle
In this github all of the Journals are added to show perspective.
Added some of the projects, only wanted to add the projects that I found the most useful. 

This class showed me more than most of the classes I have had in my opinion, this was a solid class that peaked my interest.
In this class we go over Scrum, evaluate different roles in agile and waterful, and make a conscious choice as to why one may be best. To me agile is a great way to go about running a team, prioritizing the tasks, and working as a team. I really enjoyed learning how to work as a team and how teams function. I really enjoy the way that scrum works. I love the leadership and input that this method carries. I have been in manufacturing for a long time and I have never had a role where I get a say, where I get to voice an opinion or bring awareness to an issue but this brings me hope for the future, shows me leadership and I am glad that I can take this to the next level of my future career.
